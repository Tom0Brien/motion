**motion** is a lightweight C++ library which provides core robotics algorithms for kinematics and dynamics.

The goal of **motion** is to be as simple as possible while still being incredibly fast and versatile.

## Features
The core algorithms of motion are listed below, for detailed documentation on all the available functions, see <a href="https://tom0brien.github.io/motion">documentation</a>.

## Examples
Numerous examples are provided in the `examples` folder. 

The code below demonstrates how to load in a URDF model and compute the forward kinematics.
```c++
// Create a motion model with 4 joints using URDF file defined in 4_link.urdf
auto model = import_urdf<double, 4>("4_link.urdf");

// Create a home configuration vector (all zeros).
auto q = model.home_configuration();

// Compute the forward kinematics to the link 2 from the base frame at the home configuration.
auto H = forward_kinematics(model, q, 2);
```
